**EarthScope Vision** is a high-resolution visual analytics framework for planetary-scale monitoring of Earth’s surface conditions using satellite and aerial data. The system leverages open remote sensing datasets, advanced image segmentation methods, and interpretable detection models to observe and detect dynamic earth surface events and environmental risks with precision and speed.

---

## Project Scope

EarthScope Vision is built to detect and map complex terrestrial and environmental conditions using multi-spectral satellite imagery. The system is designed to generalize across climate zones, topographies, and geographies — from urban expansion to soil degradation, from glacier melt to illegal mining patterns.

## Capabilities

- **Multi-Objective Segmentation of Land and Water Bodies**
- **Change Detection for Seasonal or Anomalous Patterns**
- **Urban Growth, Land Use Change, and Agricultural Mapping**
- **Hazard Identification: Floods, Fires, Drought Stress, Glacier Retreat**
- **Risk Layer Generation for Policy or Early Warning Systems**
- **Multilingual Visual Map Labeling (Baidu Maps API + OCR)**
